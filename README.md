Hello! My name is Dmitry Ingo Epikhin and this is my first _frontend_ project on [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/pages/about?utm_source=github&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=nodejs-package).

## Installation:

Clone this repository on your machine and write `sudo npm link` in the project directory.
Implied that you have already installed Node.js ü§ì

## How to play:

These are five console games.
To choose one of them, write `brain-even`, `brain-calc`, `brain-gcd`, `brain-prime` or `brain-prog` in your console.
Answer the questions correctly and may the Force be with you! ‚úä

**Good luck!** üçÄ
